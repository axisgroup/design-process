## Mockup to Data Map

#### What is it?
A mockup to data map is a mapping of various objects within a mockup to data elements like dimensions and measures.
#### Why do you use it?
This artifact bridges the gap between design and development. It provides the developer with a list of all the metrics required to develop the dashboard and which objects they’re associated with. 
#### When to do it?
It is typically created at the end of the project, once all the mockups and iterations are complete. 
#### How to do it?
A mockup to data map has two parts to it
* Numbering all the objects on the mockup
* Creating a detailed table and mapping it to the mockups

##### Numbering all the objects on the mockup
Add a number next to each object in the mockup.The numbering should go from objects on the top left to the bottom right. Different colored numbers can be used to distinguish between charts and UI objects like toggles, filters etc.

##### Creating a detailed table and mapping it to the mockups
This is a table that documents each object on the screen and maps it to data. Go screen by screen and and list out all the objects on each screen. List the objects in the same order as the numbers marked on the mockups. Each row in the table is an object on the screen

The table has the following columns
* Screen Name 
* Chart/Object Title
* Chart/Object Type
* Dimensions
* Measures 
* Variables -  Indicates if a chart uses a toggle that lets you switch dimensions/measures and the name of the toggle
* Description of the chart
* Rules (Constraints around the chart) - For example, certain filters are to be applied in order to view the chart, highlight points in the chart instead of filtering, certain points in the chart are highlighted by default etc.
