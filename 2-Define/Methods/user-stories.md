User stories are brief statements regarding the requirements of the system from an end-user perspective. It is often used in agile software development. While the format varies on organizational/personal preferences, the traditional format for creating user stories uses the following statement:

##### As a (User Role), I (want/need) (goal/desire) so that (benefit).

Use of “need” versus “want” indicates if a requirement is required or a “nice to have” when building the system.

As a doctor, I need to get up to medical date records so that I know how to proceed with my patients’ treatment
