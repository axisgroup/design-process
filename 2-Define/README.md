## Define: Synthesizing the research into usable models

The second phase of the design engagement is all about synthesizing research and information 
collected in the Understand phase into usable models. Usable models could be of various 
types like Persona Cards, Scenarios, and Task Analyses.

Throughout the Define phase, you should be working on creating usable models
based on the user interviews. The team should be able to synthesize the outcomes of user interviews and consolidate them into personas. The define phase typically involves creating personas but could also include user scenarios and task analysis depending on what's possible in the time frame.

## Input/Output:


###### Inputs/Prerequisites:

* Notes from Interviews: 
The team should revisit knowledge from client interviews to build personas.
 
* Assumptions and Key Take-aways:
The team should be mindful of assumptions and key take-aways from user interviews. This
shall provide ability to better develop user scenarios and personas that address
a wide range of possibilities and use cases. 

###### Outputs/Artifacts:

* Personas: 
The team should develop personas, based on the user interviews. Personas define common goals, tasks and activities of either a group of users or individual users. 

* User Scenarios: 
The team should hash out scenarios in which the solution that the engagement aims to achieve 
shall interact with the users. Determining user scenarios would better help the team to design
a truly usable and viable solution to the problem at hand.  

* Task Analysis: 
The team should perform detailed task analysis to clearly determine aspects of 
the business process that the design engagement aims to address.

## Methods in the Define phase:

#### [Personas](../2-Define/Methods/personas.md) (Required)

Creating personas help categorize and segment various aspects of the problem and the 
desired solution. They aid in providing personal characteristics and attributes to 
multiple viewpoints of the problem that the team as well as clients could easily relate to. 
Creating personas should be a comprehensive task that takes all outcomes of interviews
with the client and assumptions, bundled into a relatable use case.

#### [Empathy Map](../2-Define/Methods/empathy-map.md)
An empathy map is a collaborative tool teams can use to gain a deeper insight into their customers. Much like a user persona, an empathy map can represent a group of users, such as a customer segment. The empathy map was originally created by Dave Gray and has been gaining popularity with the agile community.

#### [Organization Chart](../2-Define/Methods/org-chart.md)
An organization chart helps the designer clarify the relationship between different personas/roles within the client's organization, and provide a baseline for prioritizing needs or grouping information. It is especially helpful when many personas or multiple business functions are involved in the Understand phase.

#### [Card Sorting](../2-Define/Methods/card-sorting.md)

Card sorting with the client helps categorize and prioritize features, ideas and different concepts so that it is easier to understand the problem. 
It is useful for working through user flow, moving features to the back burner board and merging similar ideas.

#### [Problem Statement](../2-Define/Methods/problem-statement.md)
Identifying the problem will help to determine if there is a problem, if that problem is solvable, and how to solve that problem. This step will be the first step to answering this question: What is this solution, and is it useful?

#### [User Scenarios](../2-Define/Methods/user-scenarios.md)
A user scenario is a detailed narrative that focuses on one persona. By typing it out, the team thinks through the details and tell a compelling, easy-to-understand story about the user's needs.

#### [Storyboard](../2-Define/Methods/storyboard.md)
Storyboards illustrate the how the user interact with the solution, and what the user does, thinks, or feels in the process. 

#### [User Journey Map](../2-Define/Methods/user-journey.md)
A user journey map demonstrates the flow of user experience, and highlights user's goals, actions, and emotions along the way.

#### [Task Analysis](../2-Define/Methods/task-analysis.md)
Task analysis is the process of learning how the users perform their tasks and achieve the intended goals. It helps the designer decide the tasks the solution needs to support and define the navigation and workflow. 

#### [User Stories](../2-Define/Methods/user-stories.md)
User stories are brief statements (1 or 2 sentences each) regarding the requirement of the solution from the end-user's perspective. It is a very simple method to document design requirements and it helps the design team communicate with both the client and the developers.

#### [Use Cases](../2-Define/Methods/use-cases.md)
A use case describes a list of actions or event steps that a user takes to achieve a goal or accomplish a task. It is also used to document requirements, in a much more elaborated manner compared to user stories. 

#### [Business Process Mapping](../2-Define/Methods/business-process.md)
The team should make efforts to model the business process that serves as the basis of the 
problem at hand. This shall help determine any missing aspects or loopholes in the understanding 
and could also help realize potential risks.
